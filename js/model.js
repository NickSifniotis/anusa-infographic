   The fixed data model, as provided by ANUSA in email dated 16th May 2016.
   
   Degrees, degree bands, increase in tuition, inflation, interest rates
   and median graduate starting salary are all fixed in this model.
   
   Length of degree program and annual increase in salary are variable
   and read off the user interface controls.
   
   This function simply collates all of the data and returns it to the
   main calculation function in a neat little package.
